## Introduction

This project is designed to showcase basic implementations of data structures and algorithms in C++. The goal is to help beginners understand how these data structures work and how to implement them from scratch in C++. Additionally, this repository provides a good foundation for more advanced topics.

## Data Structures

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

The **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the left child’s value is less than the parent node's value, while the right child’s value is greater. The BST supports efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

- **Operations Supported**:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Search
  - Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder

### Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports the following operations:
- **push**: Add an element to the top.
- **pop**: Remove the element from the top.
- **peek**: View the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

### Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports the following operations:
- **enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- **dequeue**: Remove the element from the front.
- **peek**: View the front element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

## Algorithms

This repository will also contain basic implementations of several important algorithms, such as:
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Other algorithms as needed

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang`).
- Make sure you have a C++11 (or higher) compatible compiler.

### Steps to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NOMANMUNIR/DSA-IN-C_.git
   cd repo-name
